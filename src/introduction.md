# Getting Started with S2 Partner API

## API Reference

The S2 Partner API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The S2 Partner API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.

### Base URL

```
https://s2-api.ventmere.io/partner/
```



## Onboarding

To use the Marketplace API, you must first have valid credentials.

Once you have been approved, your account manager will send you API keys, see: [Authentication](./authentication)
